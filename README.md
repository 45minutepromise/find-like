find -like tool is a comand line interface, that will allow you to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
The synopsis of the command line interface adhere to the following format:
``find [--P | --L] [--exclude-dir=path] --path=path [expression]``

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'find_like'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install find_like

## Command line installation
Open a terminal and do following to get ready to use find_like
 
    $ git clone ```https://github.com/45minutepromise/find-like```
    $ cd find-like
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake install
 
## Usage

Find like execute similar to how ```find``` command work on unix systems.

Lets try to understand each flag 

1. `--path=path` is a mandatory argument to start search this is the most basic command

```find_like --path='directory-path-to-start-search-from''```

```find_like --path=.```  
return all files/directory/links in the current directory recursively

```find_like --path=/Users/uditgupta```  
return all files/directory/links in `/Users/uditgupta` recursively

2. [--P | --L] These are optional argument. --P is default, in case none is supplied.

-P - Cause the file information and file type returned for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself. This should be the default behaviour.
-L - Cause the file information and file type returned for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself. If the reference file does not exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.

```find_like --L --path=.```  
return all files/directory/links in the current directory recursively, including the paths to the symlinks if any, else will resolve to originals.

3. `--name=pattern` - True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches pattern .
```find_like --path=. --name=*.rb```  
return all files/directory/links that ends with .rb in the current directory recursively.

```find_like --path=/Users/uditgupta --name=test.rb```
return all files that ends with test.rb in the `/Users/uditgupta` directory recursively.

4. `--rname=pattern` - True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using regular expression. To match a file named ``./foo/bar'', you can use the regular expression ``.*/[ba]*'' or ``.*/foo/.*'' or ``/foo/''.
```find_like --L --path=/Users/uditgupta --name=*.rb --rname="*/foo/*"```  
return all files that ends with .rb and matches regular expression `*/foo/*` in the `/Users/uditgupta` directory recursively.

5. `--type=f|d|l`
```find_like --path=. --type=d""```
return only directories in current directory recursively.

```find_like --path=f --type=d""```
return only files in current directory recursively.

```find_like --path=l --type=d""```
return only links in current directory recursively.

## Test
I have added 
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
